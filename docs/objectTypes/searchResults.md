# Search Results

This element is used to describe a set of search results that have a life beyond the execution of the query that generated them. For example where the execution of the query forms one event and the viewing of the results happens some time later and forms another event. 

This element can be used to describe a single result within a result set, a page of results from a larger result set or a full result set.

See [Complete Examples](../completeExamples/README.md) for example events.
